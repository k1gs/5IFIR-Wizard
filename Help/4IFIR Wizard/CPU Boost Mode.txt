CPU Boost Mode controls the maximum possible CPU frequency, used by system in boost mode (game loadings, tinfoil downloads, etc.)

The higher the Stage - the higher the max frequency. Combined with VMAX settings, this allows to achieve the perfect power consumption in all scenarios.

Stage ECO - 1581 Mhz
Stage 1 - 1785 Mhz
Stage 2 - 2397 Mhz
Stage 3 - 3090 MHz
