This setting contols the Undervolt logic in 4IFIR for frequencies up to 16XX MHz.

The higher the Stage - the less power is used to achive the target frequency.

To test the stability:
1. Set the minimal available CPU frequency.
2. Turn off the Governor (4IFIR RatTest -> Miscellaneous -> Frequency Governor).
3. Run some games.
